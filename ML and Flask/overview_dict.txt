It is one of Ethereum\u2019s rivals, aiming to unseat <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a> as the most popular blockchain for <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/smart-contract\">smart contracts</a>. It aims to do so by having a higher transaction output of up to 6,500 transactions per second while not compromising scalability.</p><p>This is made possible by Avalanche\u2019s unique architecture. The Avalanche network consists of three individual blockchains: the X-Chain, C-Chain and P-Chain. Each chain has a distinct purpose, which is radically different from the approach Bitcoin and Ethereum use, namely having all nodes validate all transactions. Avalanche blockchains even use different consensus mechanisms based on their use cases.</p><p>After its mainnet launch in 2020, Avalanche has worked on developing its own ecosystem of <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps\">DApps</a> and <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/defi\">DeFi</a>. Different Ethereum-based projects such as SushiSwap and TrueUSD have integrated with Avalanche.

A consequence of this are high gas fees, as is often the case on Ethereum.</p><p>To solve this problem, Avalanche designed three interoperable blockchains.</p><ul><li>The Exchange Chain (X-Chain) is employed to create and exchange the native AVAX tokens and other assets. Similar to the ERC-20 standard on Ethereum, these tokens follow a set of standardized rules. It uses the Avalanche consensus mechanism.</li><li>The Contract Chain (C-Chain) hosts smart contracts and decentralized applications. It has its own Avalanche Virtual Machine, similar to the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing developers to fork EVM-compatible DApps. It uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.</li><li>The Platform Chain (P-Chain) coordinates network validators, tracks active subnets and enables the creation of new subnets. Subnets are sets of validators, sort of like a validator cartel. Each subnet can be validating several blockchains, but a blockchain can only be validated by one subnet. It also uses the Snowman consensus mechanism.</li></ul><p>This division of computing tasks enables higher <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/de/glossary/throughput\">throughput</a> without compromising on decentralization. For instance, private blockchains on the network could require its subnet\u2019s validators to be sufficiently geographically decentralized or comply with certain regulations. Following this modular structure, Avalanche improves its interoperability with other blockchains wishing to integrate with the Avalanche ecosystem. Furthermore, the two different consensus mechanisms are designed with each blockchain\u2019s requirements in mind, further improving their efficiency.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">How Many Avalanche (AVAX) Coins Are There in Circulation?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>The total supply of AVAX is 720 million.

This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain.

When news stories started swirling regarding the possible negative effects of Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption, many became concerned about Bitcoin and criticized this energy usage. A report found that each Bitcoin transaction takes 1,173 KW hours of electricity, which can \u201cpower the typical American home for six weeks.\u201d Another report calculates that the energy required by Bitcoin annually is more than the annual hourly energy usage of Finland, a country with a population of 5.5 million.</p><p>The news has produced commentary from tech entrepreneurs to environmental activists to political leaders alike. In May 2021, Tesla CEO Elon Musk even stated that Tesla would no longer accept the cryptocurrency as payment, due to his concern regarding its environmental footprint. Though many of these individuals have condemned this issue and move on, some have prompted solutions: how do we make Bitcoin more energy efficient? Others have simply taken the defensive position, stating that the Bitcoin energy problem may be exaggerated.</p><p>At present, miners are heavily reliant on renewable energy sources, with estimates suggesting that Bitcoin\u2019s use of renewable energy may span anywhere from 40-75%. However, to this point, critics claim that increasing Bitcoin\u2019s renewable energy usage will take away from solar sources powering other sectors and industries like hospitals, factories or homes. The Bitcoin mining community also attests that the expansion of mining can help lead to the construction of new solar and wind farms in the future.</p><p>Furthermore, some who defend Bitcoin argue that the gold and banking sector \u2014 individually \u2014 consume twice the amount of energy as Bitcoin, making the criticism of Bitcoin\u2019s energy consumption a nonstarter. Moreover, the energy consumption of Bitcoin can easily be tracked and traced, which the same cannot be said of the other two sectors. Those who defend Bitcoin also note that the complex validation process creates a more secure transaction system, which justifies the energy usage.</p><p>Another point that Bitcoin proponents make is that the energy usage required by Bitcoin is all-inclusive such that it encompasess the process of creating, securing, using and transporting Bitcoin. Whereas with other financial sectors, this is not the case. For example, when calculating the carbon footprint of a payment processing system like Visa, they fail to calculate the energy required to print money or power ATMs, or smartphones, bank branches, security vehicles, among other components in the payment processing and banking supply chain.</p><p>What exactly are governments and nonprofits doing to reduce Bitcoin energy consumption? Earlier this year in the U.S., a congressional hearing was held on the topic where politicians and tech figures discussed the future of crypto mining in the U.S, specifically highlighting their concerns regarding fossil fuel consumption. Leaders also discussed the current debate surrounding the coal-to-crypto trend, particularly regarding the number of coal plants in New York and Pennsylvania that are in the process of being repurposed into mining farms.</p><p>Aside from congressional hearings, there are private sector crypto initiatives dedicated to solving environmental issues such as the Crypto Climate Accord and Bitcoin Mining Council. In fact, the Crypto Climate Accord proposes a plan to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, And, due to the innovative potential of Bitcoin, it is reasonable to believe that such grand plans may be achieved.</p></div></div></div></div></div>", "bitcoin-cash": "<div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">What Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronUp\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA show\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-bitcoin-cash\">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a> is a <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-peer-to-peer-p2p\">peer-to-peer</a> electronic cash system that aims to become sound global money with fast payments, micro fees, privacy and larger <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/block-size\">block size</a>.

However, by 2016, as the popularity of Bitcoin increased, the number of transactions on its network grew, leading to slow processing times and higher fees. Mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain proposed the hard fork for increasing the block size limit to allow more transactions per block, which went live on August 1, 2017, resulting in the creation of Bitcoin Cash. It received support from some in the Bitcoin community, like Roger Ver.</p><p>Since its inception, Bitcoin Cash has experienced its own set of challenges and milestones. One notable event was another hard fork in November 2018, which led to the creation of <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-sv\">Bitcoin SV</a> (BSV), a separate cryptocurrency.

Ethereum\u2019s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of \u201cone computer for the entire planet,\u201d theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.</p><p>In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called \u201ctokens,\u201d through the use of its <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/the-beginners-guide-to-erc-20-tokens-and-addresses\">ERC-20</a> compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched.

With ENS, the long address above could become something as simple as \u201cAlice.eth,\u201d and you can receive any type of cryptocurrency or NFT via your ENS domain.</p><p>ENS is based on two Ethereum smart contracts. The first is the ENS registry, which records three critical pieces of information: the owner of the domain, the resolver for the domain and the caching time for all records under the domain. The second smart contract is the Resolver, which translates the domain name to a machine-readable address and vice-versa.</p><p>It is worth adding that in addition to integrating with .eth names, ENS also supports the most popular DNS names, including .com, .org, .io, .app and several others.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">What is an Ethereum Killer?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>Since its inception, Ethereum has maintained its spot as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.</p><p>The remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.</p><p>In the August 2021 Ethereum network upgrade, the London hard fork contained the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-improvement-proposal-eip\">Ethereum Improvement Protocol</a>, EIP-1559. Instead of the first-price auction mechanism where the highest bidder wins, EIP-1559 introduces a \u201cbase fee\u201d for transactions to be included in the next block. Users that want to have their transaction prioritized can pay a \u201ctip\u201d or \u201cpriority fee\u201d to miners. As the base fee adjusts dynamically with transaction activity, this reduces the volatility of Ethereum gas fees, although it does not reduce the price, which is notoriously high during peak congestion on the network.</p><p>One of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum\u2019s <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-tokenomics\">economics</a> is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum\u2019s developers <a href=\"https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-basics/monetary-policy/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">justify</a> this by not wanting to have a \u201cfixed security budget\u201d for the network. Being able to adjust ETH\u2019s issuance rate via <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/consensus\">consensus</a> allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.</p><p>With the introduction of EIP-1559 however, the base fees used in transactions are burned, removing the ETH from circulation. This means higher activity on the network would lead to more ETH burned, and the decreasing supply should lead to appreciation of Ethereum price, all things equal. This has the potential to make Ethereum deflationary, something ETH holders are excited about \u2014 a potential appreciation in Ethereum price today.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">How Is the Ethereum Network Secured?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>As of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions.</p><p>There are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-dive-into-ethereum-2-0\">Ethereum 2.0</a> update, which launched in late 2020.</p><p>After the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network.

At the time of writing in mid-September 2021, the Ethereum price now for 32 Ether is roughly $116,029. The amount of money earned by Ethereum validators right now is a return of 6% APR, which equates to around 1.91952 ETH, or $6960 in Ethereum price today.

First, it merges the existing PoW Ethereum mainnet with the Beacon Chain, a PoS chain. Together, the two chains will form the new proof-of-stake Ethereum, which will consist of a consensus layer and an execution layer. The consensus layer will synchronize the chain state across the network, while the execution layer handles transactions and block production.</p><p>Second, the Merge significantly reduces ETH issuance.

With more than 14M ETH already staked, ETH could very well become deflationary after the transition. Furthermore, stakers are expected to earn between 8% and 12% <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-rate-apr\">APR</a> at current projections.

It is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that allows developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Ethereum Classic secures its network using a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm.</p><p>Ethereum, on the other hand, is a fork of the original Ethereum blockchain created in 2016. It emerged as a response to a hack that caused the loss of millions of dollars worth of Ether. The Ethereum community implemented a hard fork to reverse the hack and return the stolen funds to their owners. As a result, two separate blockchains, Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), were created.</p><p>One of the main differences between Ethereum Classic and Ethereum is their approach to governance. Ethereum has a more centralized system, with a core development team that makes decisions about the platform's future. In contrast, Ethereum Classic has a more decentralized approach to governance, with decisions made by the community through a consensus process.</p><p>Another key difference between the two is their development roadmap. Ethereum is focused on transitioning from a Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to a proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm after The Merge.

It supports built-in tokenization.</p><p>The goal of Hedera\u2019s hashgraph is to increase the speed of transactions. Moreover, the network is also focused on high-volume operations: micropayments, data integrity and tokenization.</p><p>Like the EVM, the Hedera network maintains a virtual machine that writes smart contracts in the Solidity programming language. On top of that, Hedera offers a set of built-in <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/kyc\">KYC</a> and <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/anti-money-laundering\">AML</a> checks.</p><p>From a technical point of view, Hedera is a form of distributed ledger technology. It is a hashgraph, or consensus algorithm, where users agree on the order in which transactions should be performed. However, Hedera is not exactly a blockchain. It has its own distinctiveness and works differently. With hashgraph, all transaction branches are merged, no block equivalent is thrown away, and each is used to reach consensus.</p><p>One of the most noticeable features of the network is the Gossip-about-Gossip protocol. According to Dr. Leemon Baird, Hedera's inventor, within the system nodes randomly transmit data about themselves to other nodes via hashgraph using the Gossip protocol. Soon, all nodes in a cluster become familiar with each other. Then a certain data structure is formed. It consists of a payload of transactions, a timestamp, a digital signature, and hashes to the previous structures.</p><p>HBAR is Hedera's native token that powers applications on the Hedera network. HBAR is utilized to pay for network services, transaction fees, in-app payments and micropayments. Developers can pay network fees with HBAR tokens, namely: work with <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract\">smart contracts</a>, file storage and currency exchange. HBAR is used to incentivize and pay network nodes.</p><p>Hedera Hashgraph has a decentralized governance system that is set apart. All critical decisions about pricing policy, software updates, and wealth management are made by the Governing Council.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">Who Are the Founders of Hedera Hashgraph?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>Hedera Hashgraph has two founders: Dr. Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon.</p><p>Dr. Leemon Baird is credited as the investor of the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm and currently works as Hedera's chief scientist.</p><p>Prior to founding Hedera Hashgraph, Baird accumulated more than a decade of experience in various computer science and security roles and previously worked as a senior research scientist at the Academy Center by Cyberspace Research.

The MimbleWimble upgrade was first proposed in November 2019 through a Litecoin Improvement Proposal. At the time, the Litecoin developers aimed to further focus on improving anonymity between senders and receivers.</p><p>Following the MimbleWimble upgrade at Litecoin block 2,257,920, users could opt for moe transaction privacy and explore other benefits, including blocks containing less needless transaction data. More specifically, long transactions are broken down into a single transfer by recording one input-output pair.</p><p>The MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB) upgrade was successfully activated on May 19, 2022. However, the upgrade puts Litecoin in the crosshairs of regulators who do not take kindly to privacy-capable cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Some effects of the upgrade became rather apparent when several South Korean exchanges started delisting Litecoin from their platforms shortly after the MWEB upgrade went into effect.

Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible.

If Ian was sending 200 XMR to Susan, this amount could also be split into random chunks to add a further level of difficulty.</p><p>To ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.</p><p>All of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin \u2014 especially on darknet markets.

The upgrade will completely change the way the fee mechanism works on the Ethereum network \u2014 it eliminates first-price auction as the main fee calculation mechanism and instead uses a base fee that is burned, instead of sent to miners. Although it does not lower transaction fees, it makes it more stable, allowing users to estimate costs better and reduce overpayment.</p><p>However, as MATIC tokens are burned as base fees \u2014 and MATIC has a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens \u2014 it will have a deflationary effect on the digital asset. Polygon\u2019s core team projected an annual burn of MATIC amounting to 0.27% of the token\u2019s total supply \u2014 around 27 million tokens. This deflationary pressure will most likely benefit validators and delegators the most, as rewards for processing transactions on Polygon are denominated in MATIC. Furthermore, base fee will increase automatically once the block is filled up, resulting in fewer spam transactions and less network congestion.

Since its inception in late 2020, the Ethereum-based SHIB token has grown to become a worldwide phenomenon, and is now accepted as a form of payment at hundreds of locations, either directly or through third-party intermediaries.</p><p>Shiba Inu coin was created anonymously in August 2020 under the pseudonym \"Ryoshi.\" Ryoshi says about himself that he is a nobody and not important and that the efforts to unmask his identity, even if successful, would be underwhelming.</p><p>This <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/memecoin\">meme coin</a> quickly gained speed and value as a community of investors was drawn in by the cute charm of the coin paired with headlines and tweets from personalities like Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik Buterin was long believed to be the originator of Shiba Inu, but denied such rumors on the Lex Fridman podcast on June 5, 2021.</p><p>Since release SHIB now trades on the ecosystem's proprietary DEX, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/shibaswap/\">ShibaSwap</a>.</p><p>On Sept. 17, 2021, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinbase-exchange/\">Coinbase</a>, the largest U.S.-based crypto exchange, listed Shiba Inu on their platform.

For this reason, Ryoshi can be \"pure and unbiased,\" getting satisfaction from Shiba \"in other ways.\"</p><p>It has been speculated that Vitalik Buterin was behind the initial liquidity that helped set up Shiba Inu's liquidity on Uniswap. According to Ryoshi, he had \"a fren\" he met at Devcon in Osaka that sent him 10 ETH to set up the liquidity pair on Uniswap. Ryoshi also stated that Shiba Inu was an experiment in decentralized community building, and he thus declined all the influencer requests and pitches from different exchanges he received. His \"job\" is to defend the brand and give suggestions, although he does so very sparingly, as his last blog entry dates back to May 2021.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">What Makes SHIBA INU Unique?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>The SHIBA INU website invites dog-inspired artists from all over the world to foster the \"artistic Shiba movement\" as they bring their SHIBA INU community into the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-protect-your-nfts\">NFT market</a>. SHIBA INU has also created a campaign using Amazon Smile in order to collect donations to escue real, live Shiba Inu dogs with the Shiba Inu Rescue Association.</p><p>After initially being only one meme coin of many, Shiba Inu skyrocketed to popularity after Vitalik Buterin famously burned his share of the SHIB supply. Ryoshi had given Buterin 50% of the SHIB supply, announcing that \"as long as Vitalik doesn't rug us,\" Shiba Inu would be fine.</p><p>However, Buterin decided to burn 90% of his share, which later would have been worth billions thanks to the soaring value of SHIB. The remaining 10% were sent to a charity, as were about 50 trillion SHIB more that Vitalik had donated to a COVID-19 relief fund. He stated that he did not want \"to be a locus of power\" and thus gave the tokens away. This resulted in a temporary loss of value for SHIB, which the token later recovered from after the community agreed on an arrangement with the charity in question.</p><p>Ryoshi's goal for Shiba Inu has been to see if a perpetual decentralized organization could work with no central leadership. In a blog post, Royshi noted that the rift caused by Buterin's token donation made the community stronger and would enable it to distribute further and decentralize the movement. His vision for the core ecosystem is to perform its utility while the Shiba Inu-own stablecoin becomes the globalized exchange of value.</p><p>In October 2021, SHIB surged on the news of a possible Robinhood listing and briefly flipped Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. Thus far, Robinhood has not listed SHIB, despite a petition with over 500,000 signatures calling for it. Robinhood executive Christine Brown has lauded the efforts of the Shiba Inu community, saying that one of her favorite things was seeing it engage with the community to make its wishes heard. However, Robinhood would prioritize safety over the \"short-term gain\" of a new token listing and has left Shiba Inu fans waiting since.</p><p>The October 2021 price surge famously minted a billionaire, as one wallet was uncovered that had bought $8,000 worth of SHIB in summer 2020, which was worth over $5.7 billion at SHIB's all-time high valuation. The wallet owner has not been determined, although the person appears to have sent parts of their fortune to other wallets several weeks after the price explosion.</p><p>The price surge also led to increased adoption across token holders. WhaleStats compiled data of the largest ETH wallets and found that SHIB represents over 20% of the combined market shares of all <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> tokens held by Ethereum whales. <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/crypto-com-coin/\">CRO</a> was a distant second with only 5%. SHIB also surpassed the one-million holder mark following its all-time high.</p><p>Moreover, retailers increasingly started adopting SHIB as a means of payment following its popularity among small-time investors. American electronics retailer Newegg added SHIB at the start of December 2021, partnering with crypto payments platform BitPay to unlock payments in SHIB. This followed the adoption of SHIB by over 500 merchants, according to payments firm CoinGate, with even Samsung-backed digital wallet provider ZenGo adding SHIB to its options and a <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/shiba-inu-accepted-at-restaurant-in-paris\">restaurant in Paris </a>accepting it as a payment option. At one point, the Shiba Inu community called for McDonald's to accept Shiba Inu, although the social media effort eventually fell short.</p><p>A major reason for the surging price of SHIB was a continued effort by the SHIB community to build a utility for the Shiba Inu token and the subsequent emergence of an entire Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p><p>ShibaSwap is the coin's designated DEX that started as a fork of <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sushiswap/\">Sushiswap</a> that has, in the words of Ryoshi, its \"own little twists and elements.\" Furthermore, Shiba Inu also plans to develop SHI, which will be the \"global exchange of value for plebs,\" an <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/algorithmic-stablecoin\">algorithmic stablecoin</a> pegged to one cent instead of one dollar as most other stablecoins. Its launch is planned after the Shiba <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/layer-2\">layer-two</a> solution called Shibarium, and Ryoshi envisions SHI to work in a similar way to <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/\">DAI</a>. That way, SHI would have collateral as a backstop that would push it back to one cent if the peg was lost.</p><p>According to Ryoshi, the end goal is that SHI becomes a global stable currency \"that plebs across all countries are able to use as both a store of value and method of payment.\"</p><p>In addition to SHI, a financial ecosystem is planned, and SHI would be added as a weighted pool pair on <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/curve-finance/\">Curve</a>. In that case, Ryoshi expects forks of the major DeFi protocols to appear in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which would require an immutable bridge to function.</p><p>Shiba would also start hosting localized meetups and a once-a-year ShibaCon convention that would be hosted at an easily accessible location in a country without oppressive visa restrictions \"for the sake of inclusiveness for global plebs.\"</p><p>One immediate change Shiba Inu has implemented is increasing token burns, which have sparked renewed interest in the token at the beginning of 2022. Bigger Entertainment, a crypto record label selling merch, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/how-to-mint-an-nft\">NFTs</a> and concert tickets, organized a SHIB burn party that burned over 239 million SHIB over Christmas. In total, the team has burned almost one billion SHIB since the end of October.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">How Many SHIBA INU (SHIB) Coins Are There in Circulation?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>The SHIBA INU website notes that they locked 50% of the total token supply on Uniswap, and \"threw away the keys!\" The remaining 50% was \"burned to Vitalik Buterin.\" In response to the \"gift\" from the Shiba Inu team, Vitalik Buterin sent 50 trillion SHIB tokens, worth $1 billion in Shiba Inu price at that time, to India's Covid Crypto Relief Fund.

How: invite content consumers to reward content makers directly (without intermediaries like YouTube, Facebook or Apple).</p><p>The TRON software supports <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/smart-contract\">smart contracts</a>, various kinds of blockchain systems, and decentralized applications aka dApps. The cryptocurrency platform uses a transaction model similar to <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>, namely UTXO. Transactions take place in a public ledger, where users can track the history of operations.</p><p>Therefore, the platform was built to create a decentralized Internet and serves as a tool for developers to create dApps, acting as an alternative to Ethereum. Anyone can create <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps\">dApps</a> on the TRON network, offer content, and in return receive digital assets as compensation for their efforts.

It requires an automated balancing technique that burns $1 worth of TRX to mint 1 USDD. Tron DAO Reserve is responsible for managing USDD and ensuring that its value is stable relative to the value of its underlying collateral. Also, it sets the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/annual-percentage-yield-apy\">APY</a> offered to users <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/staking\">staking</a> USDD. At the time of writing, users earn a 30% yield on staked USDD.</p><p>While USDD has been criticized for borrowing heavily from the design of <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terrausd/\">UST</a> \u2014 <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna/\">Terra</a>\u2019s algorithmic stablecoin which set off what was essentially a bank run and crash of the Terra ecosystem \u2014 certain elements set it apart. Perhaps the most notable is the decision to opt for a guaranteed over-collateralized framework, in contrast to the undercollateralized model of UST. The cryptocurrencies used as collateral on the USDD protocol include Tron, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a>, <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/\">USDC</a> and <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/\">Tether</a>.</p><p>The minimum collateral ratio of USDD has been set at 130%. Hence, the value of collateral deposited in the protocol's cryptocurrency reserves would, in practice, be higher than the value of USDD in circulation. With this, the possibility of a sustained depeg of USDD could be perceived as low. Despite its 130% minimum collateral ratio, USDD is at the time of writing backed by collateral reserves collectively worth over thrice the value of USDD in circulation. For the Tron DAO Reserve, the goal is to build a $10 billion treasury to back the value of USDD.</p><p>Another core element that is key to the stability of USDD is the operation of Super Representatives, which are Tron's institutional partners. The super representatives are incentivized entities that influence either side of the trade to absorb the potential volatility of the price of USDD. For instance, when the price of USDD falls below $1, the super representatives burn part of their USDD holding to mint TRX. This will, in turn, bring the value of USDD to the target price.</p><p>However, all these stability mechanisms have not stopped USDD from facing its fair share of volatility as the stablecoin. In June 2022, it experienced a 9% fall in its price relative to the value of 1 USD. In response, Tron DAO Reserve infused $650 million worth of USDC into USDD's collateral reserve.</p></div></div></div></div></div>", "wrapped-bitcoin": "<div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">What Is Wrapped Bitcoin [WBTC]?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronUp\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA show\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin\">Wrapped Bitcoin</a> is a tokenized version of <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> (BTC) that runs on the <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a> (ETH) blockchain.</p><p>WBTC is compliant with <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/erc-20\">ERC-20</a> \u2014 the basic compatibility standard of the Ethereum blockchain \u2014 allowing it to be fully integrated into the latter\u2019s ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, crypto lending services, prediction markets and other ERC-20-enabled decentralized finance (<a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-decentralized-finance\">DeFi</a>) applications.</p><p>WBTC is also backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio via a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians, ensuring that its price is pegged to Bitcoin at all times and allows users to transfer liquidity between the BTC and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner.</p><p>Wrapped Bitcoin was first announced on October 26, 2018, and officially launched on January 31, 2019.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-30065ccd-0 keBwNL\"><div class=\"readmoreDesc\" data-direction=\"ltr\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hAKSew top\"><h3 class=\"sc-16891c57-0 hTWugv base-text\">How Are Wrapped Bitcoin Created?</h3><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 gPFIPZ right\"><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 viaWE\"><svg class=\"sc-16891c57-0 bbyRUs c-i\" height=\"1em\" loading=\"lazy\" version=\"1.1\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><use href=\"#chevronDown\"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class=\"sc-16891c57-0 igLZtA hidden\"><div class=\"sc-95c7b9b5-0 AaeSH\"><div><p>The creation of Wrapped Bitcoin brings the world's leading cryptocurrency <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> into the world of Ethereum's <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/defi\">DeFi</a> ecosystem.

BitGo is the biggest custodian for Wrapped Bitcoin, and they will mine a certain number of WBTC and send them to the merchant's Ethereum address.</p><p>The user who wants to swap between wBTC and BTC performs a trade \u2014 through a centralized exchange or atomic swap on a decentralized exchange \u2014 to move funds to the merchant. Once finalized, the user can use their BTC/wBTC as they see fit. If WBTC is converted to BTC, the associated Wrapped Bitcoin balance will be destroyed through a burn transaction.</p><p>The WBTC <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/decentralized-autonomous-organizations-dao\">DAO</a> consists of governing members who decide on significant upgrades and changes to the protocol.
